# Unlokit
A sprite kit game in which the player needs to get a key into a lock, through obstacles and mazes

### Description
Unlokit is a challenging game of precision and intellect.

You have come to the start of a perilous journey.
You will be pushed to your limits, constantly battling the maze of puzzles and logic that you find yourself in.

Your goal is to unlock each gate by safely propelling the key into the lock.
Only then will you escape.

Each level will contain obstacles made of materials with varying characteristics.
Some obstacles are indestructible, some breakable; some cause objects to stick or to bounce off;
some block light, shielding their secrets from your eyes.

To aid you in your quest you will have at your disposal a number of tools.
Use them wisely, as they will run out very quickly. Some tools change the properties of other materials;
bombs destroy breakable obstacles; fans and gravity shifters can be attached to sticky walls to propel objects in different directions.

The early levels allow you to acquire the skills to complete each task.
However, donâ€™t be fooled - as easy as the early tasks are, the more lethal tasks will surely put an end to your complacency.

Somewhere in each stage a secret awaits the sharp-eyed adventurer.
Is that you? Will you be the one to unlock every gate and find your way to freedom?
